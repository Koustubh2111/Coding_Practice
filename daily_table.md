| PATTERN     |       QUESTION     | Python CODE LINK  | NOTES |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|------:|
| SLIDING WINDOWS     | Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (easy) | https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/submissions/  | Simple brute force solution but very time complex O(n*n-k); Faster soltuion can be obtained using a deque - decreasing queue|
|RECURSION or SLIDING WINDOWS|Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters (Medium)|https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/submissions/| Brute force Solution is very expensive; solved using recursion, time complexity is still O(N^2) in recursion, there is a sliding window approach too with O(N)|
| SLIDING WINDOWS     | Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (Medium)     |   |
| TWO POINTERS        | Pair with Target Sum (easy)    | https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-pairs-with-absolute-difference-k/submissions/   | Very simple splution using two pointers - Optimal solution ?|
|TWO POINTERS / HEAP| TWO SUM| | |
| TWO POINTERS        | Triplet Sum to Zero (medium) | | |
| FAST AND SLOW POINTERS | Happy Number (medium) | | |
| TREE BREADTH FIRST TRAVERSAL| Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (easy)| | |
|TREE BREADTH FIRST SEARCH| Zigzag Traversal (medium) | | |
|TREE BREADTH FIRST SEARCH| Reverse Level Order Traversal (easy) | | |
| TREE DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL | Binary Tree Path Sum (easy) | | |
|TREE DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL| All Paths for a Sum (medium) | | |
|TREE DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL| Sum of Path Numbers (medium) | | |
|SUBSETS | Subsets (easy) | | |
